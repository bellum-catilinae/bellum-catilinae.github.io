This week has been the die down of the election frenzy and the rapid claim of causes for the failure of the Democrats in the US.
In parts, it has been replaced by the righteous outrage over the first appointments of Trump. 
This, I do not think has had any effect on the beliefs of the people. 
<!-- more -->
Those who already disliked him, continue to dislike him and see evidence in their belief.
Those who voted for him, continue to believe it won't be that bad or celebrate the upheaval of the system. 
Of course, in the senate and house, this is a different story but that does not matter for the population at large and they decide in the longer time frame.

This fundamental divide in how we perceive the world is the most dangerous aspect of the current situation.
As long as we cannot restablish a common understanding of the world, in which we agree upon the basic facts of the situation and disagree on the interpretation, we will not be able to stop the spread of populism and with it facism and the decay of the system.
The division of facts causes two problems: the first is that a large part of the population believes outrageously wrong things and uses it as a basis for policy decisions, the second is that this prevents any meaningful discussion when people from different information camps meet since we spend the entire time establishing reality.
While the clearest of these divides is the left/right one, we see smaller divides when single issues come to dominate people's perception of the world such as with Israel/Palestine.

Traditionally, the general media has provided this common basis for understanding the world.
But as evident to everyone, this is no longer the case.
But no one has a good idea of why and how this has happened.
Everyone has their pet peeve, but I have yet to see strong evidence for any of the proposed causes.
Therefore, I will start working on modelling this divide in the hope that we can understand the causes to a point, where we can consider solutions.

What I read this week:
- [https://lpeproject.org/blog/in-praise-of-blindspots/](https://lpeproject.org/blog/in-praise-of-blindspots/) - The impersonality of the modern state is often a big critique of the left. But for it to function, it must abstract. The only question is what blindspots we allow to exist due to this abstraction
- [https://www.emptywheel.net/2024/11/10/two-elections-the-rules-were-that-you-guys-werent-going-to-fact-check/](https://www.emptywheel.net/2024/11/10/two-elections-the-rules-were-that-you-guys-werent-going-to-fact-check/) - The failure of the system to counteract Trump's messaging is maybe the biggest problem. Populism can only flourish when their narrative is not challenged in a succesfull (this is where we are failing) way
