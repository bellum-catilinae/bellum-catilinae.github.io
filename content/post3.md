The week has been pretty quiet. The most interesting thing would be the ongoing transition from people from Twitter to Bluesky. 
<!-- more -->
The transition is definitely happening and it will be interesting to see what ends up moving and what will be left behind.
Further, if my overall thesis of the centrality of the dominating narrative is a driving factor of current situation, this will be an interesting test.
On Bluesky, there should be a lot less focus on the Alt-Right narratives directly, which could lead to less of a focus on them in general.
At the same time, we already have such a fragmentation of the Alt-Right narrative that there is already a large enough population to sustain them and keep them relevant. 
Given, the traditional media's continuous focus on uncritically reporting on the central Alt-Right points, they could provide sufficient attention to keep the narrative alive.
