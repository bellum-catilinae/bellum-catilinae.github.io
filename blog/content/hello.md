The last week has been full of clear indications that the system in which "western" democracies have been functioning is failing. 

<!-- more -->

While the rise of the alt-right has been clearly on the display for almost 10 years at this point, there seemed to have been a believe that the rest of the system would be able to uphold our democractic values at the end. 
That this is not the case has clearly been the case for quite a while, but at least for me the believe, that the good in "the world" would prevail at the end, still existed. 
Finally the re-election of Trump in the US and the collapse of the coalition in Germany have destroyed this illusion.

I am writing now to make myself think about how we can revitalize the democractic system we function in.
This revitalization must be a positive approach, allowing us to re-unite the fragmenting views on the current times by giving the change we need a constructive and empowering basis, but will be drastic in some since we are ending a secular cycle. 
In the past, elite-overproduction was only ever solved in a brutal manner, one which I wish we can avoid. 

Writing into the void won't fix the world's issues itself but is a way forward for me.
